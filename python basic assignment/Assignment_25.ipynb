Instead, the generator expression returns a generator object that, when used in an iteration context, generates an item one at a time in the result."

In Python, we can write generator functions using def and yield, use parenthesized derivation to generate generator expressions, and generate generator objects using classes that define special methods named `__iter__` "

When you run the yield statement, it sends the result back to the caller and suspends the state of the function; then, the function can be restored after the last yield statement in response to the next built-in function next by the caller or The call to the __next__ method. In more advanced roles, the generator's send method similarly restores the generator, but can also pass a value to represent the value of the yield expression (commonly speaking, the yield statement will have a value when it is run, which can be assigned to a Variables). The generator function can also have a return statement that terminates the generator."

    "The `map call` is similar to the `list comprehension` - both produce a series of values, by collecting the results of the application operation on each item or other iterable object in a sequence, once Produce one. The main difference is that map applies a `function call` to each item, and list comprehension applies an `arbitrary expression`. For this reason, list comprehensions are more general; it can apply a function call expression like map , but map requires a function to apply other types of expressions. List comprehensions also support extended syntax, such as nested for loops and if clauses, which implement functions like the built-in function filter. In Python 3.X, the map is also different, it produces a generator of values; list comprehensions implement a list of results in memory at once. In 2.X, both tools create a list of results."
